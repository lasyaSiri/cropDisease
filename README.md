Crop diseases significantly impact agricultural productivity, leading to economic losses and food shortages.
This project aims to develop an image classification model for detecting crop diseases using deep learning techniques.
The model leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to analyse plant leaf images and classify them into different disease categories.
A dataset of diseased and healthy plant images is used for training and evaluation. This automated system helps farmers detect diseases early, enabling timely interventions.
Future improvements include enhancing dataset diversity, improving model accuracy, and integrating drone-based monitoring for large-scale disease detection.
